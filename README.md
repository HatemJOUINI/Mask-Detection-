# Mask-Detection-Application
Nateg Enetcom Team 2020 

# The Idea behind this project : 
Lift Lockdown can let countries face new waves of Corona Virus cases so wearing masks will be a necessity for everyone to ensure a level of protection that could help us to continue our normal life as soon as possible, so the government should monitiring 
peaple who don't wear masks  .


# Description of solution : 
To address this issue we need to identify ppl who don’t wear masks in crowded places malls, markets...To reach this goal we have created a desktop app that could be implemented in different places (hospitals, malls..) in which We have implemented an artificial intelligence model that, given a live camera feed on a target area, detects people without masks and save their pictures.that’s why wearing masks will be a necessity .

# Thechnologies used in this project : 
Due to the complexity of this project, we decided to work with several technologies .
So for the detection, we ’ve used a pre-trained model for mask detection which have pretty good accuracy, to exploit it on a reel time streaming application, we ’ve used open cv 2 and Tensorflow libraries.
On the other side, we have used Python  for developping this software and to implement all functionalities of this project. 
we ’ve used MySql, to stock credentials and encrypted images.

# GUI Interfaces : 
We have three interfaces , the first for authentification , the second for starting the whole process and crypt and decryp saved 
captures and the last one for visualisation .
